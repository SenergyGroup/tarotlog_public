# Tarotlog
Web based journal with PostgreSQL backend. Journal contains tarot themes and data storage of previous responses.

# To Do
- Change the database so that swords and pennacles line up with card index. Currently switched around.
- Get the backend loaded on Render to post the correct SQL to send the responses to the database on Neon.
- Sign in proceedures before saving a response
- Navbar and what the site will look like
- Add prompt below the description, What does this card make you think about?
- Splice the card meanings into tags where the person can click on them to add them to the SQL table (Prompt would be, which of these tags most aligns with what you wrote?)
