# tarotlog
Web based journal with PostgreSQL backend. Journal contains tarot themes and memory of previous prompts.

# To Do
- Change the database so that swords and pennacles line up with card index. Currently switched around.
- Get the backend loaded on Render to post the correct SQL to send to the database on Neon.
